Facebook interview question

Given a string without spaces, like "ilovejava", and a word list ['i', 'apple', ..., 'java', ... 'like']
of valid words, reconstruct the sentence with spaces, 'i love java'.

You may assume the input string is always valid.

This is basically the Leetcode Word Break question.
