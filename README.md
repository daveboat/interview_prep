# Google/Facebook Interview Prep Notes and Code

This is a repo containing my preparatory material for Google/Facebook software engineer and machine learning engineer
interviews in the summer of 2020. This repo contains four parts:

- Coding practice questions, in Python. Most of these are from [Leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com), and I haven't 
included any actual questions from the interviews
- Machine learning concept questions
- Machine learning system design review and case studies
- Career/behavioural questions (questions only)

Node that the career/behavioural document doesn't contain my answers, since those contain personal information. I also 
prepared a review of my past work experience, but won't be sharing this document since it also contains personal 
information.

Refer to my [blog post](https://daveboat.github.io) where I discuss my thoughts on the interview process and my 
preparation work.
